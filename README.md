Object-based card selector for the card game Dominion

This is a python script that I wrote both to gain a better understanding of object-based programming and to help facilitate setup of the board game Dominion.
Cards are represented as objects with their name and a list of attributes, then cards are collected into lists of expansions.
The code I wrote goes through an iterative process to select a list of cards to play with from a subset of the expansions, handling exceptions and preferences along the way.
